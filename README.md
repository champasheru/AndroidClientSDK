# AndroidClientSDK
The implementation for the Haptik Android assignment.
The SDK/codebase strives to provide the core Client framework, which can be used to abstract the tasks
like -
1.Backend/web services integration
2.Credential store
3.Persistence store etc.

The framework closely resembles to the iOS one which is been existing from last 3 months or more. This is the initial codebase for
the Android equivalent. It will be taken at par with iOS one & then both of these will be developed in tandem (which will also help
out to identify possible corner cases, design comparisons, platform specific requirements but commanalities as well.
The iOS framework is yet not hosted on GitHub, as it needs to be taken out of a 'purpose specific codebase' and, to be exposed
more like a SDK. Same applies for the Android equivalent (in which case, this repo will no longer exist and the codebase will be
moved to the other repo meant for Android Client SDK).

Objective is that ideally, one can also build domain/app/purpose specific code/framework/SDKs on top of these Client SDKs.
