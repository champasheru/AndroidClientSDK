# Android SDK
The SDK/codebase strives to provide the core framework, which can be used to abstract the tasks
like -
1.Backend/web services integration
2.Credential store
3.Persistence store etc.

The framework closely resembles to the iOS one which is been existing from last 3 months or more. This is the initial codebase for the Android equivalent. It will be taken at par with iOS one & then both of these will be developed in tandem (which will also help out to identify possible corner cases, design comparisons, platform specific requirements but commanalities as well.The iOS framework is yet not hosted on GitHub, as it needs to be taken out of a 'purpose specific codebase' and, to be exposed more like a SDK.

Objective is that ideally, one can also build domain/app/purpose specific code/framework/SDKs on top of these Client SDKs.
