/**
 * Created by ${saurabhATchampasheruDOTbuild} on 15/5/16.
 *
 * The interface lays down the methods contract for the corresponding web service operations.
 * The concrete/implementing classes will be implementing a particular style of web service.
 * Let's say, that the web service with same semantics is exposed as REST as well as SOAP; as such, the particular
 * implementation of this interface will implement the specific style & underlying semantics.
 * For a RESTful web service, this interface could be looked upon as the one which specifies the End Points & relevant i/p & o/p.
 * For SOAP web service, this interface could pretty well be looked upon as the one which exposes the specific operations on the
 * remote's proxy object.
 * FOR NOW, MARKER INTERFACE.
